So this is my first post on this blog to be.

I wanted to start with the reasons for this birth. This is intended to serve as a repository for software development problems and their respective solutions. Making it a quick back reference, but also as a "share with a friend" link.
Given that fact, I believe many posts might only be a collection of quotes and links.
Few of them might be actually original content. But, well, we have to start somewhere.
